/**
 * Class Client
 *
 * This is the base client to call the Canada Post API.
 *
 * It uses Guzzle Http to connect. This client will be used for all the calls
 * to the API.
 *
 * As multiple endpoints need to be called during different transactions this
 * should not implement the endpoint it will use. Instead, the endpoint will be
 * provided by the call.
 *
 * However, all calls need to be authenticated. This will maintain a global
 * authentication as well as consider the proper endpoint based on the current
 * setting between production and development.
