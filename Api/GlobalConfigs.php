/**
 * Interface GlobalConfigs
 *
 * Mainly to use as a global interface to retrive different configurations from
 * the scope. This can be used during the API call, during the building of the
 * request body or while reading the request response.
 *
 * Note that request body and response constants should NOT be included in this
 * file. This file should only contain static values to ease the retrieval of
 * configuration values.
 *
 * This should contain all the keys in the config.xml file and the ones that are
 * relevant but not there.
 *
 * Configurations in sub-modules or modules that depend on this module can also
 * be added here as long as they are relevant and prefixed with the name of the
 * module that they relate to. The other option is to create another module
 * specific configuration interface with the constants for the module that uses
 * them.
